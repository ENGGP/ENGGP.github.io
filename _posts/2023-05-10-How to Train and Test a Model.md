# How to Train and Test a Model

By simply using FastAi, an model for image detection can be produced. In this example we will be training a model that recognises birds and forests. This is done through the following steps
- Download 200-300 images of birds and forests.


# How RandomSplitter work
RandomSplitter will divide up all the images in the pool into training set and validation set. Training set will train the model 
to regconise certain images. Validation set is a set of images that will be used to test your model.
