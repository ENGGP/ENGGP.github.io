# What is fastai

The python library utilised to train our model is called FastAi, produced by Jeremy Howard in 2020. Python library fastai is 'a deep learning library which provides practitioners with high-level components that can quickly and easily provide state-of-the-art results in standard deep learning domains, and provides researchers with low-level components that can be mixed and matched to build new approaches'(docs.Fast.ai, 2020). It is easy to use and flexible. We can also migrate code from Pytorch or Ignite to FastAi or use them in conjunction. To summarise the procedure of training a prediction model, the process is done by scapping 200-300 images of the internet, transformed the images into a format readable by vision_learn() and tune the model through 3 interations. Below shows the procedures to train our model.
