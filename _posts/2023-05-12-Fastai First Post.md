## How RandomSplitter work
RandomSplitter will divide up all the images in the pool into training set and validation set. Training set will train the model 
to regconise certain images. Validation set is a set of images that will be used to test your model.

## Confusion matrix
A matrix that depicts the the ability of your model's image detection. Ideally values on the diagonal are one the rest are 0.
It shows how many prediction are correct and incorrect per class. It helps in understanding the classes that are being confused
by model as other class.
