# Loss function
Loss is the penalty for a bad prediction. That is, loss is a number indicating how bad the model's prediction was on a single example. If the model's prediction is perfect, the loss is zero;
otherwise, the loss is greater. The goal of training a model is to find a set of weights and biases that have low loss, on average, across all examples.
