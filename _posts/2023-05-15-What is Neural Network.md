# What is Neural Network

## Neural network
Neural network assigns random weights to each neuron at the first layer. It then evaluates the loss function and the next layer will then recalculate the weights so that the loss function is minised.
This done for each layer therefore the accuracy of the model will increase and loss will decrease over time
