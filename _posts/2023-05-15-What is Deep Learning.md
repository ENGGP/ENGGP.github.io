# What is Deep Learning
Deep learning is a branch of machine learning which is a branch of artificial intellegence. A deep learning algorithm teaches computers to think and recognise situations much like a human brain.Deep learning models can complete tasks that normally requires human intellegence such as image and sound recognision and text translation. Deep learning model is also be utilised in industry complex senarions such as road sign detection used by self driving cars, medical image analysis used for cancer cell detection and hazard detection used in factories.


## What is Neural Network
Neural network assigns random weights to each neuron at the first layer. It then evaluates the loss value and error and it will refine the layer. This done for each layer therefore the accuracy of the model will increase and loss will decrease over time. This method is call back propagation.

A neural network consist of layers interconnected neurons and each layer and each is build from the previous layer through refinement and prediction optimisation. This process is called forward propagation where data and statistics are ingested at the input layer and after prcoessing prediction is made at the output layer.
